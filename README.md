This is a basic guide to get you started with Create React App, a popular tool for setting up React projects quickly and efficiently. Below are key commands and resources for building, testing, and deploying your app.

## Key Scripts

In the project directory, the following scripts are available:

### `npm start`
This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your app. The page will reload when you make edits, and any linting errors will show up in the console.

### `npm test`
This command starts the test runner in watch mode. You can learn more about running tests in the [Create React App testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
Creates a production-ready build of your app in the `build` folder. It optimizes React for best performance, including minifying and hashing filenames. Your app is ready for deployment. For deployment tips, check the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
The `eject` command is for advanced users who need full control over configuration files. This command removes the dependency on Create React App's pre-configured setup and copies all configurations (like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint) into your project. **Warning:** This is irreversible, so proceed with caution.
